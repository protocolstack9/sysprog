- what is process?
  (from wikipedia) In computing, a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. It contains the program code and its current activity.

  As object code in execution—active, alive, running programs—processes are more than just assembly language;
    they consist of data, resources, state, and a virtualized computer.

int execl( const char *path, const char *arg, ...);
int execlp( const char *file, const char *arg, ...);
int execle( const char *path, const char *arg , ..., char * const envp[]);
int execv( const char *path, char *const argv[]);
int execvp( const char *file, char *const argv[]);

  'l' : arguments are passed in list form
  'v' : arguments are passed in vector(array) form

  'p' : using $PATH environment
  'e' : using new environment, be passed as envp
